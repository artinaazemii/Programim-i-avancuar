AI-Assisted Data Analysis Tool - Code Explanation

This script is designed to perform basic data analysis on CSV files, providing users with functionality to calculate statistics, generate histograms, compute correlations, and detect outliers. Below is an explanation of how each section of the code was implemented:

1. **CSV File Reading**:
   - A function `read_csv(file_path)` was created to read the input CSV file using the `pandas.read_csv()` method. It returns the data as a DataFrame, which allows for easy manipulation and analysis of tabular data.
   - Error handling is included using a try-except block to ensure that if the file cannot be read (e.g., file not found or incorrect format), an error message is displayed.

2. **Statistics Calculation**:
   - The `calculate_stats(data, column)` function calculates basic statistics: mean, median, mode, and standard deviation for a specified column.
   - The `pandas` functions `.mean()`, `.median()`, `.mode()`, and `.std()` are used to compute these statistics.
   - The mode calculation returns the first mode when there are multiple modes.
   - If the column does not exist in the dataset, an error message is returned.

3. **Histogram Generation**:
   - The `generate_histogram(data, column, bins)` function generates a simple text-based histogram.
   - The column's values are divided into bins, and the frequency of values falling within each bin is counted.
   - A dictionary is used to store the frequency of values in each bin. The result is returned as a visual representation of the histogram using hash (`#`) characters.

4. **Correlation Calculation**:
   - The `find_correlation(data, column1, column2)` function computes the Pearson correlation between two columns using the `.corr()` method from pandas.
   - Pearson correlation is a measure of the linear relationship between two variables, and the function returns this value as output.
   - The code ensures that both columns exist in the dataset before attempting to calculate the correlation.

5. **Outlier Detection (IQR Method)**:
   - The `find_outliers(data, column, threshold)` function detects outliers using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method.
   - The IQR is calculated by subtracting the 25th percentile (Q1) from the 75th percentile (Q3). The outlier thresholds are defined as values below (Q1 - threshold * IQR) or above (Q3 + threshold * IQR).
   - Rows outside this range are flagged as outliers and returned as a DataFrame.

6. **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**:
   - The script uses the `argparse` library to parse command-line arguments and specify the action to be performed (e.g., statistics, histogram, correlation, or outliers).
   - The user must provide the CSV file, the type of analysis, and the column(s) to analyze. For correlation, an optional second column can be provided, and for histograms, the number of bins is adjustable.
   - Based on the command provided, the corresponding function is called, and the result is printed to the console.

7. **Error Handling**:
   - Throughout the script, checks are made to ensure the required columns are present in the dataset before performing any operations.
   - If an invalid column or operation is requested, a descriptive error message is returned to the user, guiding them to provide the correct input.
